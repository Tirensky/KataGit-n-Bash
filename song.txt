When the words
Weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost
And lead only by the stars
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chasing the neon throne
Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in
Plants awoke
And they slowly grow
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
