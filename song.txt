When the words
Weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost
And lead only by the stars
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chasing the neon throne
Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in
Plants awoke
And they slowly grow
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
The air is silk
Shadows form a grill
If I lose control
I feed the beast within
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne
Breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Breathe in, breathe out
And let it in
Plants awoke
And they slowly grow
Beneath the skin
So breathe in, breathe out
Let the human in
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne
If I could only let go
